//Key Terms
    //Process
        //A program currently running on a machine/
        //In a sufficiently large system, you should assume that a process
        //may get terminated at any time 

    //Server
        //A machine or process that provides data/service for a client.
        //Typically by listening for incoming network calls/requests.

        //A single machine or piece of software can be both a client and a server at the same time
        //E.g. single machine can be a server for end users and as a client for a database

    //Node/Instance/Host
        //These three terms refer to the same thing most of the time. 
            //A virtual or physical machine on which the developer runs processes
            //Sometimes, the word 'server' also refers to this concept as well.

    //Availability
        //The likelihood/odds of a particular server or service being up and running at any point in time. 
        //Typically measured in percentages.
        //A server that has 99% availability will be operational 99% of the time
        //This would be said to have 'two nines' of availability

    //High Availability
        //Used to describe systems/service that have high level of availability - usually '5 nines' or more. (99.999%)
        //Sometimes abbreviated 'HA'

    //Nines
        //Refers to percentages of uptime 
            //99% - two nines - 97 hours of downtime per year
            //99.9% - three nines - 8.7 hours of downtime per year
            //99.99% - 4 nines - 52 minutes of downtime a year
            //99.999% - 5 nines - 5 minutes of downtime per year 

    //Redundancy
        //Process of replicating parts of a system in order to reduce downtime and increase reliability

    //SLA
        //'Service-level agreement'
        //SLA is a collection of guarantees given to a customer by a service provider
        //SLAs usually make guarantees on a system's availability, amongst other things
        //SLAs are made up of one or multiple SLOs (service-level objectives)

    //SLO
        //'service-level objective'
        //A guarantee given to a customer by a service provider. 
        //SLOs usually make guarantees on a systems availability, amongst other things 
        //SLAs are made up of SLOs
