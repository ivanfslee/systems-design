//Key Words
    //Relational Database

    //Non-relational Database

    //Key-Value Store - A flexible NoSQL database thats often used for caching and dynamic configuration.
        //Popular options include DynamoDB, Etcd, Redis, ZooKeeper

        //Etcd - (a technology/product you can use) A strongly consistent and highly available key-value store that's often used to implement
            //leader election in a system
            //https://etcd.io/

        //Redis - An in-memory key-value store.  (a technology/product you can use)
            //Does offer some persistent storage options but is typically used as a
            //really fast, best-effort caching solution 
            //Redis is also often used to implement rate limiting
            //https://redis.io/

        //ZooKeeper - a technology/product you can use
            //A strongly consistent, highly available key-value store.
            //Often used to store important configuration 
            //or to perform leader election.

//Structure of Relational Databases is often very useful because of the strong querying capabilities

//On the flip side, the same structure imposed on you could be large and cumbersome 

//In comes the key-value store
    //One of the most popular NoSQL databases out there
