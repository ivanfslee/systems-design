        //Popular options include DynamoDB, Etcd, Redis, ZooKeeper

        //Etcd - A strongly consistent and highly available key-value store that's often used to implement
            //leader election in a system
            //https://etcd.io/

        //Redis - An in-memory key-value store. 
            //Does offer some persistent storage options but is typically used as a
            //really fast, best-effort caching solution 
            //Redis is also often used to implement rate limiting
            //https://redis.io/

        //ZooKeeper
            //A strongly consistent, highly available key-value store.
            //Often used to store important configuration 
            //or to perform leader election.
